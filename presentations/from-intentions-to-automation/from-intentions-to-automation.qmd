## From Intentions to Automation: The Science of Lasting Behavior Change

While 81% of weight loss attempts fail within a year, habit-based approaches show 3x higher 18-month success rates (Cleo 2018). This deck decodes the neural mechanisms and intervention strategies that make habits stick.

## The Habit Trinity: Cues, Repetition, Automation

::: {.columns}

🧠 **Automaticity**: Myelinated neural pathways bypass conscious control (Wood 2016)
:::
::: {.column width="34%"}
⏰ **Context Anchoring**: 67% stronger habits form with event vs time cues (Judah 2012)
:::

## From Effort to Automation: The Habit Lifecycle

1. **Conscious Choice**: Motivational interviewing boosts initiation by 41% (Gardner 2019)
2. **Action Planning**: Implementation intentions increase adherence 18% (Moss 2020)
3. **Context Locking**: 23% better retention with temporal chaining (Karppinen 2017)
4. **Neural Cementing**: Myelin growth tracks with automaticity scores (d=0.73)
